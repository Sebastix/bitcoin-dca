## This is a fork of Bitcoin DCA tool
Forked from https://github.com/Jorijn/bitcoin-dca

## Requirements
* You need to have an account on a supported exchange;
* You need to have Docker installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/;
* You need to have an API key active on a supported exchange. It needs **read**, **trade** and **withdraw** permission.

## Supported Exchanges
| Exchange | URL | Currencies |
|------|------|------|
| BL3P | https://bl3p.eu/ | EUR |
| Bitvavo | https://bitvavo.com/ | EUR |

## About this software
The DCA tool is built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to specify your own schedule of buying and withdrawing. A few examples that are possible:

* Buy each week, never withdraw.
* Buy monthly and withdraw at the same time to reduce exchange risk.
* Buy each week but withdraw only at the end of the month to save on withdrawal fees.
